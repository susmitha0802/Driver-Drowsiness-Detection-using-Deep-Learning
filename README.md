# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Driver Drowsiness Detection is a deep learning-based system developed in Python, using OpenCV, Inception V3, and LSTM which can detect and prevent driver drowsiness by monitoring the driver's facial expressions and eye movements in real-time. The system includes an alarm feature that alerts the driver when drowsiness is detected.
